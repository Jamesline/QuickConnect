                <h2>Executing University digital transformation with cloud based integration</h2>
            </div>
                  
            <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>  
                     
            <p> 
                University of Surrey, located in Guildford, is regarded as one of the UK's leading research universities. 
                
                University of Surrey’s vision is to be a leading global university, building on the distinctive heritage of practice-based learning and providing an excellent student experience, embracing the future by focusing on digital transformation. 
                
                One of the key strategic objectives for the university is to consolidate excellent teaching and continue to improve the student experience, responding to students’ growing expectations of enhanced academic quality, support services, facilities, accommodation and pathways to employment. 
                
                A key aspect in delivering the strategic objectives was to have a modern integration solution to interface with the core university systems providing services for both students and staff.  
                
                Cluster Reply were engaged in late 2019 to undertake an integration design workshop, from which an integration strategy and architecture was recommended.  
                
                The initial engagement resulted in Cluster Reply architecting and delivering an Azure integration solution using the Cluster Reply QuickConnect Framework in collaboration with University of Surrey’s team.  
            
            </p>
            
            <h4>The Challange</h4>
            
            <p>

                The University of Surrey had a legacy integration solution based on Oracle SOA Suite. With growing license costs, coupled with undertaking a ‘cloud first’ digital transformation strategy, the university were looking for a partner to recommend and lead the deployment of a modern cloud based integration platform to meet changing business requirements.  
                
                With a shift in student engagement due to an increase in remote learning, it was imperative that University of Surrey implemented a new integration platform to be flexible and extensible to quickly react to this change.  
            
            </p>

            <h4>The Solution</h4>

            <p>
                The integration solution needed to be able to respond to changes in university priorities, offering flexibility and adaptability to offer a continued level of service for the staff and students to minimise educational impact.  

Cluster Reply implemented an Azure hosted Enterprise Integration Platform as a Service solution for the University.  A number of projects are now being undertaken to both migrate from the existing Oracle integration solution and to support exciting new initiatives within the University, including the deployment of a new offering for students and with ‘Surrey Learn’, the virtual learning environment being of particular importance as students were unable to physically learn on campus.  

The teams from University of Surrey and Cluster Reply had to adapt to remote delivery early in the project, with the flexibility of a cloud based solution the transition was seamless with no impact to delivery and collaboration.
