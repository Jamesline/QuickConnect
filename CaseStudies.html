                <h2><strong> University digital transformation with cloud based integration</strong></h2>
            </div>
                  
            <h4>Abstract</h4> 
                     
            <p> 
                University of Surrey, located in Guildford, is regarded as one of the UK's leading research universities. 
            </P>
            <p>    
                University of Surrey’s vision is to be a leading global university, building on the distinctive heritage of practice-based learning and providing an excellent student experience, embracing the future by focusing on digital transformation. 
            </p>    
                One of the key strategic objectives for the university is to consolidate excellent teaching and continue to improve the student experience, responding to students’ growing expectations of enhanced academic quality, support services, facilities, accommodation and pathways to employment. 
            <p>    
                A key aspect in delivering the strategic objectives was to have a modern integration solution to interface with the core university systems providing services for both students and staff.  
            </p>
            <p>    
                Cluster Reply were engaged in late 2019 to undertake an integration design workshop, from which an integration strategy and architecture was recommended.  
            </p>
            <p>   
                The initial engagement resulted in Cluster Reply architecting and delivering an Azure integration solution using the <Strong>Cluster Reply QuickConnect Framework</Strong> in collaboration with University of Surrey’s team.  
            
            </p>
            
            <h4>Challange</h4>
            
            <p>

                The University of Surrey had a legacy integration solution based on Oracle SOA Suite. With growing license costs, coupled with undertaking a ‘cloud first’ digital transformation strategy, the university were looking for a partner to recommend and lead the deployment of a modern cloud based integration platform to meet changing business requirements.  
            </p>
            <p>    
                With a shift in student engagement due to an increase in remote learning, it was imperative that University of Surrey implemented a new integration platform to be flexible and extensible to quickly react to this change.  
            
            </p>

            <h4>Solution</h4>

            <p>
                The <strong>QuickConnect</strong> integration solution needed to be able to respond to changes in university priorities, offering flexibility and adaptability to offer a continued level of service for the staff and students to minimise educational impact.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Cluster Reply implemented an Azure hosted Enterprise Integration Platform as a Service solution for the University.  A number of projects are now being undertaken to both migrate from the existing Oracle integration solution and to support exciting new initiatives within the University, including the deployment of a new offering for students and with ‘Surrey Learn’, the virtual learning environment being of particular importance as students were unable to physically learn on campus.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The teams from University of Surrey and Cluster Reply had to adapt to remote delivery early in the project, with the flexibility of a cloud based solution the transition was seamless with no impact to delivery and collaboration.

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>
                Grainger Plc are a market leader in the UK private rented sector, owning and operating thousands of rental homes across the country.  
            </p>
            <p>
                With more than 100 years of experience in renting homes, Grainger are committed to operational excellence and great customer service to achieve high occupancy rates and sustainable rental growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grainger are ambitious about leading the way and giving their tenants the best renting experience. Investing in technology and their online digital platform, CONNECT, secures their leading position in the market, facilitating continued growth. 
            </p>  
            </p>
            <h4>Challange</h4>
            <p>
                Essential to Grainger’s growth strategy was to enhance the services provided to their customers, through the offering a new self-service portal enabling tenants to submit payments, service requests and to facilitate various processes e.g. a new tenancy agreement. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With Grainger’s business growth ambitions, it was clear the incumbent systems and processes would not support or scale to match Grainger’s future vision. As such, Granger embarked on a major business transformation exercise via the CONNECT programme. All fundamental services were reviewed resulting in the procurement of a number of new systems - finance system, invoicing system, CRM and various other ancillary systems, all of which needed to be integrated.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Grainger’s mantra was to ‘adopt not adapt’ and so look to implement the best of breed functionality provided out of the box by the newly procured systems as much as possible and so minimise technical customisations. 
            </p>
            <p>

                With the majority of the new systems hosted in the cloud, the logical approach was to implement a cloud based integration solution.  
            </p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
                Reply were engaged at the start of the CONNECT programme working in partnership with Grainger to define the programme requirements, the technical scope and to implement a robust integration solution in alignment with the Grainger business transformation strategy. This resulted in Reply architecting and delivering an Azure based integration solution, underpinned by <Strong>Cluster Reply’s Integration Accelerator, QuickConnect</Strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <Strong>QuickConnect</Strong> is based on tried and tested Microsoft technology and is the distillation of Reply’s 20 years’ of integration experience. <Strong>QuickConnect</Strong> provided Grainger with a strong starting point for the resolution of typical integration problems (performance, end point management, monitoring, governance and security). QuickConnect offered risk free integration, delivering both an iPaaS solution and hybrid integration platform to respond to Grainger’s evolving requirements.

                <h2><Strong>NHS Property Services generates new revenue with QuickConnect</Strong></h2>
            </div>
            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>
                NHS Property Services was formed in 2013 following the merger of property services departments from 161 NHS Primary Care Trusts across England. Today, the NHS Property Services portfolio consists of 3,500 buildings worth over £3 billion.
            </p>
            <p>
                NHS property Services decided to solve its technology and business challenges through executing a digital transformation strategy using Microsoft Azure. 
            </p>

            <h4>Challange</h4>
            <p>
                The primary objective is to reduce cost, create a fit for purpose property estate and generate vital revenue for reinvestment in frontline patient care. Like any complex business merger, progress hadn’t always been easy. In particular, NHS Property Services had to face the considerable challenge of managing and integrating technology systems from hundreds of different organisations.

            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the systems were provided by Commissioning Support Units within different areas across the NHS estate, which meant that NHS Property Services had no control over how systems were managed or interfaced with each other. NHS Property Services decided to change strategic direction. Break away from legacy vendor relationships and run independently from all NHS systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                The NHS PS team wanted to create central control and put an end to the messy, point to point integration they had in the past. They wanted to understand where their data was coming from at all times and use it to operate more efficiently and profitably.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
                Cluster Reply enabled NHS Property Services to realise the vision through the implementation of an iPaaS built on Microsoft Azure using the <Strong>Cluster Reply Integration Accelerator, QuickConnect</Strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Cluster Reply, in partnership with NHS Property Services delivered a flexible, high-performance architecture allowing the new SaaS applications to share data freely and seamlessly via one centralised master data source.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, applications such as e-billing, credit control, purchasing and facilities management can all work together seamlessly. In just 4 weeks the integration 103,370 data transactions between these systems via 17 distinct data exchanges not ever deemed possible. Ultimately, enabling NHS Property Services to generate increased revenue to be reinvested to support services to enhance patient care.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Quotes</h4>
            <p>
               'We had a large number of disparate, unconnected applications and no ‘master’ of data for areas like finance, e-billing, capital works, facilities management or credit control,’ says Kevin Canning, Solutions Architect for Technical Services in NHS Property Services. ‘It was difficult to perform even basic functions. For example, we couldn’t invoice for rented properties consistently, and we couldn’t take on more properties into our portfolio. We were losing revenue as a result.’
            </p>
            <p>
                ‘The beauty of what we have achieved with Cluster Reply is that we can decouple and recouple applications as we choose,’ says Kevin. ‘That’s going to be very beneficial as we move forward. We can now add and remove applications without serious knock on effects and keep innovating with freedom.’
